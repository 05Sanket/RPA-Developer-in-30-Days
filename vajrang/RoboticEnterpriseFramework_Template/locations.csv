It also is an evidence for the beneficiary to prove to any entities which may require proof of vaccination specially in case of travel. Vaccination not only protects individuals from disease, but also reduces their risk of spreading the virus. Therefore, there could be a requirement in future to produce certificate for certain kind of social interactions and international travel.  In this context the certificate issued by Co-WIN has built in security features to guarantee genuineness of the certificate which can be digitally verified using approved utilities which are provided in Co-WIN portal. The certificates can be verified by visiting verify.cowin.gov.in and scanning the QR code. Who is responsible for providing the vaccination certificate?

Why do I need a vaccination certificate? A COVID Vaccine Certificate (CVC) issued by the government offers an assurance to the beneficiary on the vaccination, type of vaccine used, and the certificate also provides the next vaccination due. It also is an evidence for the beneficiary to prove to any entities which may require proof of vaccination specially in case of travel. Vaccination not only protects individuals from disease, but also reduces their risk of spreading the virus. Therefore, there could be a requirement in future to produce certificate for certain kind of social interactions and international travel.  In this context the certificate issued by Co-WIN has built in security features to guarantee genuineness of the certificate which can be digitally verified using approved utilities which are provided in Co-WIN portal. The certificates can be verified by visiting verify.cowin.gov.in and scanning the QR code. Who is responsible for providing the vaccination certificate? The Vaccination Center is responsible for generating your certificate and for providing a printed copy post vaccination on the day of vaccination itself. Please do insist on receiving the certificate at the Center. For Private Hospitals, the charges for providing a printed copy of the certificate are included in the service charge for vaccination.

No, there is no limitation in the number of times one normally logs in to Co-WIN portal and accesses the certificate. However, if one tries innumerably, the system treats such cases as a bug. If one inadvertently enters a wrong OTP, a waiting period of 180 seconds is to be maintained before one can request another OTP. After trying once do you need to wait certain amount of time to try again? In other words, can you only do it once every hour or so? No, if you have given wrong OTP 3 times, the system will not allow to login from the same instance.

You would be issued new Vaccination Certificate after taking due vaccine dose.  The vaccination certificate made available to me, do not show correct date on which I have been vaccinated, what is the reason and how to correct it?

If the beneficiary does not receive the confirmation SMS, it is recommended that the beneficiary should contact the vaccination center and ask for the vaccination certificate before leaving the vaccination Centre (refer FAQ 56 & 57). In case the date of vaccination is incorrectly recorded on the vaccination certificate, an option has been provided under “Raise an Issue” Tab on the dashboard, for ‘Vaccination date correction’, through which the request for corrections in vaccination dates can be submitted. At the time of submission of such request, the documentary proof for the requested correction must also be uploaded.

Why do I need a vaccination certificate? A COVID Vaccine Certificate (CVC) issued by the government offers an assurance to the beneficiary on the vaccination, type of vaccine used, and the certificate also provides the next vaccination due. It also is an evidence for the beneficiary to prove to any entities which may require proof of vaccination specially in case of travel. Vaccination not only protects individuals from disease, but also reduces their risk of spreading the virus. Therefore, there could be a requirement in future to produce certificate for certain kind of social interactions and international travel.  In this context the certificate issued by Co-WIN has built in security features to guarantee genuineness of the certificate which can be digitally verified using approved utilities which are provided in Co-WIN portal. The certificates can be verified by visiting verify.cowin.gov.in and scanning the QR code. Who is responsible for providing the vaccination certificate? The Vaccination Center is responsible for generating your certificate and for providing a printed copy post vaccination on the day of vaccination itself. Please do insist on receiving the certificate at the Center. For Private Hospitals, the charges for providing a printed copy of the certificate are included in the service charge for vaccination. Where can I download vaccination certificate from? You can download vaccination certificate from the Co-WIN portal (www.cowin.gov.in) or the Aarogya Setu app or through Digi-Locker by following the simple steps. You may do so by using the mobile number used at the time of registration. Can you only access the Co-WIN website and register to get your vaccination certificate a limited number of times in a day? No, there is no limitation in the number of times one normally logs in to Co-WIN portal and accesses the certificate. However, if one tries innumerably, the system treats such cases as a bug. If one inadvertently enters a wrong OTP, a waiting period of 180 seconds is to be maintained before one can request another OTP. After trying once do you need to wait certain amount of time to try again? In other words, can you only do it once every hour or so? No, if you have given wrong OTP 3 times, the system will not allow to login from the same instance. To login again refresh the browser to create a new instance and login with your mobile no. and new OTP. How can I access COVID Vaccination Certificate from DigiLocker? You can find vaccination certificate in DigiLocker under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare under Health category. Click on COVID Vaccine certificate and enter Beneficiary Reference ID to access the certificate. My vaccination certificate is generated even if I have not been vaccinated, can it be cancelled? Yes, if you are not vaccinated and your vaccination certificate is generated, in this case you may revoke your vaccination status from Precaution dose to fully vaccinated, from fully vaccinated to partially vaccinated or from partially vaccinated to non-vaccinated through raise an issue option in your Co-WIN account. You would be issued new Vaccination Certificate after taking due vaccine dose.  The vaccination certificate made available to me, do not show correct date on which I have been vaccinated, what is the reason and how to correct it?  A confirmation SMS is sent by the Co-WIN system immediately upon successful recording of the vaccination event. If the beneficiary does not receive the confirmation SMS, it is recommended that the beneficiary should contact the vaccination center and ask for the vaccination certificate before leaving the vaccination Centre (refer FAQ 56 & 57). In case the date of vaccination is incorrectly recorded on the vaccination certificate, an option has been provided under “Raise an Issue” Tab on the dashboard, for ‘Vaccination date correction’, through which the request for corrections in vaccination dates can be submitted. At the time of submission of such request, the documentary proof for the requested correction must also be uploaded. District Immunization Officer of respective districts would examine the matter and would resolve the issue. The status of the request can be tracked by the beneficiary through the “Track Status” tab. Once the request is resolved, an update is also sent to the beneficiary through SMS. Why do I need an International Travel Certificate? Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has introduced the International Travel Certificate which complies with international standards for travel abroad. The certificate is a proof that you have received all doses of vaccination for travelling internationally. This certificate lets you enter countries without any hassle of quarantine or testing for COVID-19. Can I apply for International Travel Certificate?
